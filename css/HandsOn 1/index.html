     <h2 class="c1">What is CSS ?</h2>
     <div class="c2">
        <ol>
            <li>CSS stands for cascading style sheet</li>
            <li>CSS describees how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen,paper,or in other media</li>
            <li><span class="c3">Css is not necessary</span>
            <span class="c4">CSS saves a lot of work</span>It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once</li>
            <li><span class="c5">External stylesheets are stored in CSS files.</span></li>
        </ol>
     </div>
     <h2 class="c1">CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</h2>
     <div class="c6">
        <ul>
            <li>Inline-by using the style attribute inside HTML elements1</li>
            <li>Internal-by using style element in the head section</li>
            <li>External-by using a link element to link to an external CSS file</li>
            <li>The most common way to add CSS is to keep the style in external CSS files.However,
            <span class="c7">in this<br> tutorial we will use inline and internal style,</span>because this is easier to demonstrate and easier<br> for you to try it yourself.</li>
            
        </ul>
     </div>
     <p class="c8">when comparing CSS class vs ID,the differences in that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements.ID,on
        the other hand,applies a style to one unique element.ID is also<br> special in that you can use a special URL to link directly
    to an element and its used by JavaScript.</p>
    <p class="c9">In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element are range of elelments on a web page.once an element has been targeted,a style or set of styles can be applied to the<br>
    element.</p>
    <p class="c10">There is a wide range of selectors available. two of the most commonly used are class and id. both are used to target elemnets to which a style should be applied.</p>
